HOW TO USE IT
----------------------------

- Camera movement: like Maya, Unity, etc (mouse and arrows)

- How to load objects:

	- Go to Windows->Assets
	- Right click to go to the explorer (you can add aditional objects, remember to select refresh after)
	- Left click to an (.fbx) file and select load to scene
	- Note: it takes a while because first converts all the files to the engine's own format
